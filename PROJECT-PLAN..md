First, let's consider answering these questions before we proceed: **What?** and **Why?**

### What is Talk? - *Timestamp 2:19 AM*

What is talk? I also asked myself that. But, when I think about how social media platform nowadays are having your details sold, some have discreet consent, but some are worser. But with Talk, you don't even need to create an account to view, post, comment, or even messaging one another doesn't need an account. In Talk, your privacy matters the most, that even these known cookies that leaves crupms all over the internet is not to be found here. With just a few clicks, do a few this-and-that and your post is public right away!

### Why create Talk? - *Timestamp 2:22 AM*

Its hard enough to trust some known social media platform, but with Talk, every users matters. I created Talk to help anyone around the world to voice out their thoughts, opinions, contradictions, or even a whole articulated page that feels like reading a book. That's Talk for you.

Quick Thinking:

I'll try to make this into a single-application page. But I assume that it would be hard that way. So, maybe, I'll just use static HTML for a better performance for both the server and the users.

Companions: I will surely be using AI services, mostly Gemini AI by Google. For suggestions of new features and functions, coding, and improvements.
