# Content Moderation Policy for Talk Platform

**Last Updated:** August 16, 2025

At Talk, we are dedicated to fostering a safe, inclusive, and respectful environment for all users. This Content Moderation Policy outlines the principles and processes we follow to manage content on the platform, always adhering to our core values of privacy-first, community-driven, and minimal data collection.

## 1. Guiding Principles for Moderation

Our moderation efforts are guided by the following principles:

*   **Privacy-Preserving:** All moderation actions are performed without collecting or using any personal identifying information (PII) of the content creator or other users. Decisions are based solely on the content itself and its adherence to our policies.
*   **Community-Focused:** We aim to empower the community to help maintain a healthy environment. Community feedback and reporting mechanisms are crucial to our moderation process.
*   **Transparency (where possible):** While respecting anonymity, we strive for transparency in our moderation decisions and processes, providing clear guidelines and aggregate reporting on moderation activities.
*   **Fairness & Consistency:** Moderation decisions are applied consistently and fairly across all content, based on the established policies.
*   **Minimal Intervention:** We aim to intervene only when necessary to uphold the Terms of Service and ensure a safe environment, respecting freedom of expression within those boundaries.

## 2. Prohibited Content

The following types of content are strictly prohibited on the Talk platform:

*   **Illegal Content:** Any content that promotes, facilitates, or depicts illegal activities.
*   **Hate Speech:** Content that attacks or demeans a group based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, disability, gender, age, sexual orientation, or other similar characteristics.
*   **Harassment & Bullying:** Content intended to intimidate, abuse, or harass individuals or groups.
*   **Personal Identifying Information (PII):** Sharing of any personal identifying information (yours or others') including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, or private photos.
*   **Spam & Unsolicited Commercial Content:** Repetitive, unwanted, or promotional content.
*   **Impersonation:** Content that falsely represents you as another person, entity, or the Talk platform itself.
*   **Violence & Graphic Content:** Content that promotes or glorifies violence, or depicts excessively graphic or disturbing material.
*   **Child Exploitation:** Any content related to child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or child exploitation is strictly prohibited and will be reported to relevant authorities.
*   **Malware & Phishing:** Content containing malicious software, links to malware, or attempts to phish for sensitive information.

## 3. Moderation Process

Our moderation process is designed to be efficient and privacy-preserving:

*   **Community Flagging:** Users can flag content they believe violates our policies. This is a primary mechanism for identifying problematic content.
*   **Automated Detection:** We may employ privacy-preserving automated tools (e.g., keyword filters, pattern recognition) to identify potential policy violations, without storing or analyzing personal data.
*   **Anonymous Review:** Flagged or automatically detected content is reviewed by human moderators. These moderators do not have access to any personal information about the content creator.
*   **Action Taken:** If content is found to violate policies, actions may include:
    *   **Removal:** The content is removed from public view.
    *   **Anonymization/Redaction:** If only a portion (e.g., PII) violates policy, that portion may be redacted or anonymized if feasible, allowing the rest of the content to remain.
    *   **Rate Limiting/Temporary Suspension (Anonymous):** In cases of repeated or severe violations, the anonymous source of the content may be temporarily rate-limited or prevented from submitting further content for a period, based on non-identifying session data.

## 4. Appeals Process (Anonymous)

If your content is moderated and you believe it was done in error, you may have the option to appeal the decision. This process will also be designed to maintain anonymity:

*   **Anonymous Appeal Submission:** A mechanism will be provided to submit an appeal without revealing your identity.
*   **Re-review:** The moderated content will be re-reviewed by a different moderator or a moderation team to ensure fairness and accuracy.
*   **Anonymous Communication:** The outcome of the appeal will be communicated back through the platform, without requiring personal identification.

## 5. Transparency & Reporting

We are committed to transparency regarding our moderation efforts:

*   **Aggregate Statistics:** We may periodically publish aggregate, anonymized statistics on moderation actions (e.g., number of posts removed, types of violations) to demonstrate our commitment to a healthy platform.
*   **No Individual Reporting:** Due to our strict privacy policy, we cannot provide individual reports on moderation actions or disclose information about other users.

## 6. No User Identification

It is crucial to reiterate that all content moderation activities are conducted without any attempt to identify individual users. Our systems are designed to process content based on its adherence to policies, not based on who submitted it.
